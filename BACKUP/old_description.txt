[h1]The only cure - PZ mod[/h1]
Bitten by a zombie? Do not panic ! At least if it's at the level of arms.

I introduce you the only cure. The saw. If you apply the saw to the infected area before the infection spreads too far into your body. The infection will go away and you can resume your life as normal!

Small flat on the other hand, during the application of the remedy you risk to scream very loudly. That's why I recommend having a box of painkillers with you at this time. (The fuller the box, the more efficient). I also recommend having a bandage, with alcohol is better, at the time to reduce healing time.

Once the saw is applied, you end up with a wound that needs to heal. For that you can wait but it takes a lot of time. You can also operate with a surgeon's kit to speed up the process. There are three craftable kits, some better than others. You can also heal instantly by using an oven but that gonna leave a mark.

Now with your hand cut off, everything will take a long time and some actions (like holding a weapon in your hand) are no longer available. But then how to do? Once again, don't panic. I also offer prostheses to replace your severed limb! (Not available for fully cut arms). There are 3 prosthesis models, wooden hook, metal hook and metal hand. Equipped with a better prosthesis to reduce the time taken for actions. You need to be fully heal to equip it.

Thanks Arko Piktuviry for the spanish translation!
